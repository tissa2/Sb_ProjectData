This project consists of predicting the gold price using daily news heads and previous prices. The daily has been collected from investing.com and range from January 1 to July 04, 2021 (see Gold_Historical_Data_01-01-2021_07-04-2021 .csv) . Data preprocessing including preprocess the text dat and merge with daily gold price has been done in SB_project-7-14-2021.ipynb and Data Visulization in TextData-Analysis.ipynb. A deep learning model has been in SB_project-7-18-2021.ipynb and valided on test set:
